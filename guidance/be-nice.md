# Contributors Code of Conduct

This guidance is intended for project owners wanting to understand more about the 
.NET Foundation Contributors Code of Conduct, why it exists and how to raise
awareness of it in your community.

The .NET Foundation was created to foster an open, innovative and inclusive
community around open source .NET. To clarify expected behaviour in our
communities we have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).
This code of conduct has been adopted by [many other open source communities](http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/)
and we feel it expresses our values well. 

For a full copy of the [code of conduct](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct),
see the .NET Foundation Website http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct

## Applying the Code of Conduct to your project

First of all, it is important that you read the [code of conduct](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct)
and understand when to be on the look out for unnaceptable behaviour, what to do if you see
it or if someone reports their concerns to you.

Any concerns passed to you by your community can be forwarded to the
.NET Foundation by email to conduct@dotnetfoundation.org for help and advice. If a member of
the community is not happy with the response of the project maintainers then
they should email conduct@dotnetfoundation.org with details.

The .NET Foundation recommend that you also display a link to the code of conduct
in your README.md file and in your CONTRIBUTING.md file if you have one.  You can
see an example of this in the [Open Live Writer](http://github.com/openlivewriter/openlivewriter)
project

See the [README.md guidance](readme-guide.md) for the suggested MarkDown to use
when linking to the Code of Conduct

When introducing the Code of Conduct links to an existing project, it is important 
to do this via a Pull Request to allow the community time to read the code
of conduct and make sure that they understand it.  Below are some FAQ's you 
might find useful.

## Code of Conduct F.A.Q's

#### What happens when I report a concern?
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be 
reported by contacting conduct@dotnetfoundation.org. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated by two person
team at the .NET Foundation and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The confidentiality of the
person reporting the incident will be kept at all times by the .NET Foundation.
Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek additional insight
from others with relevant expertise or experience but will maintain the
confidentiality of the person reporting.

#### Does anyone else do this?
This code of conduct has been adopted by [many other open source communities](http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/)
including Mono, Rails, AngularJS, Eclipse, Swift and other projects in the .NET Foundation

#### What should I do when a thread goes toxic
There are rare instances when a particular issue or thread in a forum will decend into a set of unhelpful comments,
occasionally drawing in a large number of unhelpful comments from outside of your regular community.
Rather than one individual being particularly problematic or harrasing another, a crowd might start to 
turn on an individual or group. If any project maintainer wants advice on how to deal with a particular issue
including when to lock an issue, ban a user or remove abusive messages in a conversation then 
please drop us a line on the conduct@dotnetfoundation.org address.
