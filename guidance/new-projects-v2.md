# New Project Onboarding
Hello!  We are excited you are interested in bringing your project over to the .NET Foundation family.  To ensure the process is transparent and runs smoothly, we have put together a walk-through of the onboarding process to guide you.  Once you start the application process, we will work with you throughout to complete the work
## Your Project and the .NET Foundation
Participation in the .NET Foundation exposes your project to the wider world of .NET developers and helps you to build a better community.  The following details the three main steps you and your project will complete joining the .NET Foundation

The .NET Foundation has established a set of [eligibility criteria](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects) that your project must meet

When you are ready to apply to join, [fill out a new project application](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project+application&template=application.md&title=)

## Joining the .NET Foundation
Joining the .NET Foundation involves submitting an application, review of the project by the .NET Foundation board, signing the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) once it’s been accepted and completing a set of post on-boarding steps.  We will walk through them all in detail below so it’s an easy and straightforward process

**Step 1:** Project application and review by the .NET Foundation Board

**Step 2:** Signing the CLA

**Step 3:** Project Onboarding

## Project Application and Review by the .NET Foundation Board

When you are ready to apply to join, [fill out a new project application](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project+application&template=application.md&title=)

You can complete the application in GitHub directly, email us a copy of the document, or attach a copy of the document to the GitHub issue.  To help with some of the common questions in the application, we’ve included some extra details to help you along

**Contribution vs Assignment.**  The difference is in the contribution model is who actually owns the copyright. It is important, but in terms of practical operation of the project it’s pretty transparent

|Type|What it Means|Why you'd select it <img width=900/>|
-----|-------------|-------------------
|Contribution|The project grants the .NET Foundation a license and rights to the intellectual property and source code. The project agrees that it is their work, and the .NET Foundation can protect your copyright.|Info needed please|
|Assignment|The project / company gives the .NET Foundation the project, the .NET Foundation grants it back.|Info needed please|

Normally for community projects we recommend contribution. It’s more applicable for projects that have had multiple contributors over a period of time. Assignment is more applicable for a project that was developed in-house by a company, as they have had complete and traceable ownership of the project throughout its lifespan. Either works fine and has little to no day to day impact on the project once it joins from an actual open source development / shipping software point of view. I’d honestly have to go back and check the transfer agreements for a project to tell you what contribution model they chose. So, whatever makes your lawyers happiest is best.

Once you’ve submitted the issue, it will be reviewed by the Project Review committee and they will follow up with any questions on your application.  After the review is complete and it’s ready to move forward, the .NET Foundation Board will review it.  The Board meets monthly and reviews new projects sent over from the Project Review committee.  After the board votes to approve a new project, signing the CLA is up next

## Signing the CLA
After the .NET Foundation board approves the project, it’s time to sign the CLA and move the project to the .NET Foundation.  To setup and distribute the CLA, we will need a few pieces of information from you

* **Project Transfer Signatories:** This should be the top contributors, typically the top 2-5 contributed more than a few hundred lines of code
  * We will need their email addresses, so we can send the CLA for signing (we currently use DocuSign)
* **Project Trademarks - Disclaimed vs Licensed.** Signing the CLA includes how you want to handle any trademarks for the project.  These typically include the project name and potentially anything exclusive to the trademark for your project

By default, the .NET Foundatio selects **licensed** in the CLA

|Type|What it Means|Why you'd select it <img width=900/>|
-----|-------------|-------------------
|Disclaimed|Project agrees not to enforce the trademark against the .NET Foundation or anyone else.|Info needed please|
|Licensed|Project retains ownership of any trademarks and licenses the .NET Foundation to use them.|Info needed please|

Once we have the signatories identified, we will send out the CLA via DocuSign for everyone to complete.  Once all parties have signed it and we’ve filed it away, we move forward with onboarding the project itself

## Project Onboarding
The last stage of joining the .NET Foundation involves a set of activities to bring your project in line with all .NET Foundation projects and help you join the broader .NET Foundation community.  These items will all be tracked via the GitHub issue (that was created when you filled out your project application) and additional details are included in a detailed email you will receive.  

|Tasks|Background|
|-----|----------|
|Configure CLA bot| detailed description needed|
|Mailing List|Join the project leader mailing list|
|Slack channel|Joing the project leader slack channel|
|License updates + copyright|Move your license to MIT (or continue to use Apache)|
|Code of Conduct|Review and add to your README|
|Project list|Get your project included on the project list on the .NET Foundation website|
|Project layout|Adjust your project layout to conform to .NET Foundation guidelines|
|README updates|Updates to your README for the .NET Foundation|
|Website updates|Updates to your project website (if you have one outside of GitHub)|

## That's it!  You are done!
Once we’ve completed all the above, your project will be full on-boarded to the .NET Foundation!  We are definitely excited to have your project join!
