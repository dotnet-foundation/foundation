# Mono

[Mono](https://mono-project.com) is an cross-platform and open source implementation of the .NET framework 
that was started independently in 2001.   The technology was originally developed
by Ximian, which was acquired by Novell, then at Novell, then at [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com) and 
now [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com).

Mono provides a complete SDK (compiler, runtimes, libraries) to develop .NET applications on 
a wide range of platforms. It is most commonly used as a .NET runtime that supports the .NET desktop
API profile, as well as an embeddable runtime that is used to power mobile platforms (Xamarin.iOS,
Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.tvOS, Xamarin.Mac, Xamarin.watchOS) and gaming consoles.

Mono is part of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) and [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)
supports it as part of the Xamarin commercial offerings. Additionally, the Mono project has an active and 
enthusiastic community.
