# WCF

WCF includes a collection of client-oriented libraries from the Windows Communication Foundation that enable WCF applications built on [.NET Core](http://github.com/dotnet/core) to communicate with WCF services. 

These libraries match the functionality available for the Windows Store profiles, but the use of .NET Core now offers broader reach and the potential for cross-platform WCF applications. They are suitable for mobile devices as well as mid-tier servers communicating with WCF services.
