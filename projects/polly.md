# Polly

Today's cloud application, mobile, data-streaming, and IoT technologies all depend vitally on reliable connectivity. But underlying systems can fail, and networks are notoriously fickle: outages, latency, transient blips, spikes in load - all challenge 100% reliability.

[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/) helps you navigate the unreliable network. By providing resilience strategies in fluent-to-express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback, Polly can help you reduce fragility, and keep your systems and customers connected!

The closest project comparison is to [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki) in the java world. The .NET space has no comparable offering. We are building Polly to solve the same problems, but in a flexible, lightweight, ‘keep things simple’ spirit.

Best of all, that lightweight approach means Polly can work anywhere .NET can run. Whether you’re building an occasionally connected mobile application, or a heavy duty business intelligence service, simply drop in the Polly NuGet package and get started right away!
