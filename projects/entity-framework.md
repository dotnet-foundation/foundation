# Entity Framework

Entity Framework is the recommend data access technology for new applications in .NET. It is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

### Entity Framework has two versions: 

[Entity Framework 6](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6) is the legacy Entity Framework for .NET Framework, that runs only on Windows.

[Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) is a new, lightweight and extensible .NET Standard based version for .NET applications running Windows, Linux and macOS.
