# Prism

Prism is a framework for implementing maintainable, extensible, and testable XAML applications on WPF, Xamarin, Windows Store Apps, and Windows 10 UWP apps. Prism helps application developers implement multiple design patterns and principles including Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Dependency Injection, Modularity, UI Composition, Commands, and PubSub Events. Prism was first developed by Microsoft patterns & practices and then transferred to the current Prism open source team in 2015.
