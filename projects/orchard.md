# Orchard CMS 

[Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) is a free, open source,
community-focused Content Management System built on the ASP.NET MVC
platform. Orchard is built on a modern architecture that puts
extensibility up-front, as its number one concern. All components in
Orchard can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily
composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very
decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily
apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition
system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact
presentation that you need for your content.
